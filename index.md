### CPSC 120

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-06-jeremy-and-quoc)

    Lab 6, part 2, was my favorite because I have always wanted to learn how to code a simple guessing game in C Plus Plus using infinite loops. I was able to practice controlling infinite loops by using boolean variables to check if the player wanted to continue playing the game. I was also able to practice using the break keyword to terminate while and do-while loops instead of the entire program.

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-christian-h-and-quoc-l-2)

    Lab 8, part 3, was my favorite because it was my first time learning how to code a program in C Plus Plus that can write to a file and check if it is open or closed. I was able to practice using std::ifstream to open up and modify files and if statements to check whether or not a file can still be opened and modified or closed with an error statement that returns one. I was also able to practice using while loops for std::get_line() to read the contents of an entire file, store the content in a temporary storage, and then display the content using std::cout.

* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-hector-and-quoc-2)

    Lab 12, part 1, was my favorite because it was my first time learning how to code a gif in C Plus Plus using GraphicMagick. I was able to practice using GraphicsMagick, specifically Magick::ColorRGB, to create a series of red, green, and blue color channels. I was also able to practice using counter-controlled for loops with the sine function, sin(), to make certain color channels flicker or shift in specific directions.
