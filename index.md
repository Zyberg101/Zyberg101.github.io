### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2, was my favorite because I have always wanted to learn how to code a simple guessing game in C Plus Plus using infinite loops. I was able to practice controlling infinite loops by using boolean variables to check if the player wanted to continue playing the game. I was also able to practice using the break keyword for while and do-while loops to terminate infinite loops instead of the entire program.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3, was my favorite because it was my first time learning how to code a program in C Plus Plus that can write to a file and check if it is open or closed. I was able to practice using std::ifstream to open up and modify files and if statements to check whether or not a file can still be opened and modified or closed with an error statement that returns one. I was also able to practice using while loops for std::get_line() to read the contents of an entire file, store the content in a temporary storage, and then display the content using std::cout.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1, was my favorite because it was my first time learning how to code a gif in C Plus Plus using GraphicMagick. I was able to practice using GraphicsMagick, specifically Magick::ColorRGB, to create a series of red, green, and blue color channels. I was also able to practice using counter-controlled for loops with the sine function, sin(), to make certain color channels flicker or shift in specific directions.
